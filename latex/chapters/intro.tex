\section{Introduction}
LLMs are getting more and more powerful. And they are also a powerful tool for solving math problems.

CoT, prompt engineering, and few-shot learning are the most popular methods to improve LLM math reasoning. 

In the last few months, we have seen a lot of progress in the performance of LLM reasoning ability, especially test time scaling, which improves the performance of LLM ressoning through spending more computing time and resource, such as sequential multiple CoT and parallel CoT and then verification.

However, under resource constraints, the performance of LLM math reasoning is limited. In real life, we cannot always spend unlimited computing time and resource to solve a math problem. For example, in autonomous driving, the car needs to make a decision in real time.
