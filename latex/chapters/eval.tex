\section{Evaluation}
Here we should analyze our experiment results and list several findings.

\begin{itemize}
    \item there is quite room for time-constrained reasoning for released models
    \item different sizes within the same model series
    \item whether fine tuning using o1-like method can help when under resource constraints
    \item whether math domain specific models can help when under resource constraints
    \item whether prompt engineering can help when under resource constraints
    \item there is no snake oil for ant model on any device
\end{itemize}
